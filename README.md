[How to use Github / How to submit](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/labs?id=github-classroom)

For this lab, you will include all of your "answers" in this README file. Make sure to cite any sources you use. 

Reminder, this is the syntax to include an image in a markdown (`.md`) file:
```markdown
![](path/to/file/image.png)

Example - if a file called test.png was located in this folder:
![alt-text](test.png)
```

## Task 0: Declare your AI Usage

After you completed this lab, make sure to submit the AI declaration form via MS Form and also upload a PDF copy of your responses to this repository and include the link to PDF in this README file. Note, you must submit this form regardless if you use AI or not. Failure to submit this form will be considered a violation of AI course policy. More details about the AI-usage course policy can be found [here](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/ai-policy).

[Link to AI Usage Disclosure MS Form](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CS-5500/#/ai-policy?id=disclosure-of-ai-use)

- You will need to log in with your SFU email to access the form. If you're unsuccessful, try using a different browser or incognito mode. Clearing your cache and cookies may also help.

Name the file in the following format: 

`L#_AI_Declaration_FirstName_LastName_StudentID.pdf`

Example (Lab 3):

`L3_AI_Declaration_Parsa_Rajabi_123456789.pdf`

## Task 3: Lab Questions (11 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file:

### Q1
While Git is a distributed version control system installed locally on computers, Github is an online SaaS service built to run Git in the cloud. Git allows developers to manage their source code history by their own machines as repositories, meanwhile, Github acts as a centralized location hosting Git repositories for sharing. They work together to implement the version control.<br>
(source: https://www.theserverside.com/video/Git-vs-GitHub-What-is-the-difference-between-them#:~:text=The%20key%20difference%20between%20Git,is%20an%20online%20SaaS%20service.)

### Q2
A distributed system is a system in which the complete code base history is mirrored on every developer's computer. It enables branching and merging, imporves the ability to work offline, and provides multiple locations for backups.<br>
(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control)

### Q3
- Modified: Changes have been edited and waited to be saved.
- Staged: Changes have been saved to the staging area and waited to be committed.
- Committed: Changes have been made and recorded to the repository's history for good.

### Q4

#### Q4 (i)
git clone: Copy a remote online repository to the local as a same new repository.
#### Q4 (ii)
git status: Print the status of the current working directory and staging area.
#### Q4 (iii)
git fetch: Fetch and copy the updates from a remote online repository to the local branch.
#### Q4 (iv)
git init: Creat a new repository.
#### Q4 (v)
git log: Print the log, showing all former changes of the repository.
### Q5
A .gitignore file is a file located in the repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. It is shared with all other users who clone the repository, commit the .gitignore file in to your repository. Its main purpose is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.<br>
(source: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files, https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20gitignore%20files,being%20reintroduced%20in%20later%20commits.)

## Task 4: Video Questions (4 marks)

Include answers as described in the [Lab 1](L1.md) file.

### Q1
The Software Development Life Cycle is the process for developing software, including seven phases: planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. During planning, the customer and product manager define the application's purpose. Requirement analysis involves outlining detailed functional and technical requirements with the engineering team. In the design phase, aspects such as the user interface, business rules, programming languages, and frameworks are determined. Implementation includes hardware setup, coding, UI design, and preparing test cases, followed by testing, where bugs are identified and resolved. Finally, the software is deployed and maintained to ensure it remains functional over time.

### Q2
The SDLC is import in software projects because it defines the development phases and the responsibilities of each character over different phases, ensuring the software development team could cooperate seamlessly and the software could be built as customers' requirements efficiently.
